# key bindings

- When a screen is active, toggling tab key is switching the tabs in the background.
- maybe remove the global keybindings for tab. they are not direct access methods to functions
- the table widget also has some keybindings and events does implement.
- bindings should be used if they are already default: remove tab for the table to select the task. arrow keys are already configured on the widget
- verify this in tests test_tui.py.
