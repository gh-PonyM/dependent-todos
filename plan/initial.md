- TODO A python code example using dependency trees and then get a list of items
	- What cool tool could we make out of this?
		- I want to have a list of tasks that have been registered as tasks
		- On adding a new task, I want to enter a message, then an id, and then in the next step, be able to fuzzy search existing id's as dependencies
		- I want a single python file, it should have a uv comment to specify the depenencies
		- We might not need any external dependencies
		- I want to use toml as dependency
		- Note the min required python version (that has toml as lib installed)
			- make conditional uv install for older python versions (if the tomllib changed, check this)
